<h1>About Page</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Best Burgers</strong>, where three friends with very different tastes — and very strong opinions — come together to celebrate the world’s most perfect food: the burger.</p>

<p>What started as a group chat argument about whether smashed patties beat thick patties has grown into a full‑blown cooking blog dedicated to exploring every corner of burger culture. From backyard classics to gourmet experiments, we’re here to share recipes, techniques, reviews, and the occasional heated debate.</p>
<h2>🔥 Our Mission</h2>
<p>We want to make burger‑making fun, accessible, and endlessly creative. Whether you’re a seasoned grill pro or someone who just wants to make a better weeknight dinner, our goal is to help you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Master essential techniques</li>
    <li>Discover new flavor ideas</li>
    <li>Learn from our experiments (and occasional disasters)</li>
    <li>Enjoy the process as much as the final bite</li>
</ul>

<h2>🍟 Join Us on the Journey</h2>
<p>We’re constantly testing new recipes, exploring regional burger styles, and sharing what we learn along the way. If you love burgers as much as we do — or you’re just hungry — you’re in the right place.</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Best Burgers</strong>. Let’s cook something amazing together.</p>
